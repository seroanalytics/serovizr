R API for the SeroViz app. Based on the [porcelain](https://github.com/reside-ic/porcelain) and [plumber](https://github.com/rstudio/plumber) frameworks.

## API Specification
Docs are available when running the API locally on port 8888, via 
```
http://127.0.0.1:8888/__docs__/
```

The easiest way to run the API locally is via Docker:

``` 
 docker run -p 8888:8888 seroanalytics/serovizr:main
```

Alternatively, to run from R, first clone this repo and then from this directory run:

```r
  devtools::load_all()
  serovizr:::main()
```

The docs are maintained via an [openapi](https://www.openapis.org/) specification
contained in `inst/spec.yaml`, and [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) files in `inst/schema`.

## Developing
Install dependencies with:

```r
remotes::install_deps(".", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Start the API locally by running:

```r
devtools::load_all()
serovizr:::main()
```

## Testing
Run tests with:

```r
devtools::test()
```
